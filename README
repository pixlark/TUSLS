*** THE ULTIMATE SUBREDDIT LINK SCRAPER ***
*******************************************

The name is meant to be ironic. This is a very simple and easy to use link
scraper for reddit.

INSTALLATION:

For this to work, you need to set up an "application" on your reddit account
that will allow the link scraper to connect to Reddit. This is a very simple
process:

1. Go to your reddit preferences page
2. Click the apps tab
3. Click "are you a developer? create an app..."
4. Enter any name
5. Select the "script" button
6. In the "redirect uri" field, enter any url. http://www.google.com/ works.

Your reddit is now set up. Now, go to the folder you downloaded this in and
rename "account.py.sample" to "account.py"

Finally, fill out the information in account.py with your reddit username and
password, as well as the "client id", which is the long code under the name of
your reddit app, and the "secret" which is listed in your app next to the word
"secret".

Now, just make sure you have the python3 packages tkinter and praw installed.
Simply run gui.pyw either from the command line or by double-clicking. The
interface is fairly self explanatory, but here's a quick rundown:

Under "Subreddit" enter the name of the subreddit you want to scrape from.

For the "Category" drop-down, select the category you want to scrape. These
are equivalent to the sorting methods on each subreddit.

Under "Limit" select how many posts you want to churn through.

Under "Submission Title Regex" you can enter a regular expression that will
match to the titles of posts and only download the ones that match. Leaving it
blank downloads all posts it comes across.

Under "File Type Regex" you can enter a regular expression that will operate
on the file type. Essentially, you just create a group of possible file types
that you want to download. For example, '(png|jpg|jpeg)' will download most
images. Leaving this blank will download nothing, if you want to download
everything enter '*'.

The DOWN option will download every matching link to a folder named after the
subreddit, and the LINK option will store the titles and links in a text file
named after the subreddit.
